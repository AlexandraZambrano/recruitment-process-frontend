This is our app to manage internal recruitment processes for NTT DATA Spain and Affiliates. 

Here you can add, edit or delete candidates, interviewers, interviews, processes and view statistics on the selection processes.

- Angular 13: https://angular.io/
- Typescript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- Angular Material: https://material.angular.io/
- HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML
- CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/css/

With Springboot to power our fullstack application, we made a responsive website to manage selection processes.

Our goal is to facilitate the hiring process of the HR department, bringing together all the roles in a single app.

This was our first project using Angular Material and it has made some tasks much easier, besides improving the loading process of the app itself.

In this project we have worked with agile development through Scrum and Kanban, divided into six sprints and assigning our tasks in each week. Good organization is essential and we had a good time working as a team, both programming in pairs and helping our partner.

:memo: Lessons Learned:
---

Angular helps to develop dynamic websites while working on individual components and separate features at the same time. It makes the development process easier.

Also, we have used Material library for the first time, which has made it much easier to develop features and design.

We have used JWT in Angular to work on the security feature (registration, login and authorizations).
